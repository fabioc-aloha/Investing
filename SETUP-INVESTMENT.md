# Investment Management Cognitive Architecture Setup Guide

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR GITHUB COPILOT**: This file contains complete setup instructions for implementing the Project Catalyst cognitive memory architecture optimized for investment management, including portfolio analysis, risk assessment, financial modeling, market research, and comprehensive investment strategy development.

**UPDATED: July 15, 2025** - Enhanced with document presentation standards, table formatting protocols, and professional analysis capabilities.

## 💰 Investment Management Automated Setup Protocol

**Execute these steps in order to establish a complete cognitive architecture system for investment management with professional document presentation standards:**

### Step 1: VS Code Configuration (Required)

Add these settings to VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
  "chat.promptFiles": true,
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": [".github/instructions"],
  "files.associations": {
    "*.portfolio": "json",
    "*.analysis": "markdown",
    "*.model": "json",
    "*.strategy": "markdown",
    "*.research": "markdown",
    "*.valuation": "json",
    "*.risk": "json",
    "*.performance": "json",
    "*.allocation": "json",
    "*.screening": "json",
    "*.backtest": "json"
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/confidential-research/**": true,
    "**/proprietary-models/**": true,
    "**/insider-info/**": true
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/confidential-research/**": true,
    "**/proprietary-models/**": true,
    "**/insider-info/**": true
  },
  "editor.rulers": [80, 120],
  "editor.wordWrap": "wordWrapColumn",
  "editor.wordWrapColumn": 80,
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["*.portfolio", "*.model", "*.valuation"],
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "timestamp": {"type": "string"},
          "version": {"type": "string"},
          "data": {"type": "object"}
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "markdown.extension.toc.levels": "2..6",
  "markdown.extension.completion.enabled": true
}
```

**Access settings.json**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"

### Step 2: Create Investment Management Directory Structure with Professional Standards

**ENHANCED WITH DOCUMENT PRESENTATION STANDARDS & CURRENT ACHIEVEMENTS**

## 🎨 **Professional Document Presentation Standards (IMPLEMENTED)**

### Company Logo Integration for Equity Analysis
```html
<div align="center">
<h1>Company Name (TICKER) - Investment Research</h1>
<img src="https://finnhub.io/api/logo?symbol=TICKER" alt="Company Logo" width="200" height="auto" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto;"/>
</div>
```

**Quality Standards Achieved:**
- **200px width standardization** across all equity analyses
- **High-resolution Finnhub API** for optimal logo quality
- **Center-aligned HTML headers** for professional presentation
- **Single logo placement** to avoid duplication

### Risk Assessment Matrix Table Formatting (CRITICAL)
```markdown
| **Risk Criteria** | **Score/Rating** | **Signal** | **Weight** | **Recommendation** | **Comments** |
|-------------------|------------------|------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Altman Z-Score | 2.45 | Safe | High | BUY | Above 2.99 thresh |
| Piotroski F-Score | 7/9 | Strong | High | BUY | Good quality |
| DCF Fair Value | $15.20 | Undervalued | High | BUY | vs current $12.50 |
```

**Table Rendering Requirements:**
- **Comment length limit**: Under 20 characters to prevent Markdown breaks
- **No hyphens**: Use "revenue growth" not "revenue-growth"
- **Concise abbreviations**: "Strong fund", "Market lead", "Comp adv"
- **Quality assurance**: Preview all tables before finalizing

```markdown
# Project Catalyst - Investment Management Cognitive Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global Investment Management Declarative Memory. Optimized for portfolio analysis, risk assessment, financial modeling, market research, and comprehensive investment strategy development.

## 🧠 Investment Management Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity for investment management)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across investment management procedural (.instructions.md) and investment strategy episodic (.prompt.md) systems

## 💰 Investment Management Working Memory - Quick Reference (Limit: 4 Critical Rules)

| Priority | Rule | Load | Auto-Consolidate |
|----------|------|------|------------------|
| P1 | `@fiduciary-duty` - Always act in the best interests of clients and maintain the highest ethical standards | Low | Never |
| P2 | `@risk-first` - Assess and manage risk comprehensively before pursuing returns | Medium | >30 days unused |
| P3 | `@meditation` - Auto-consolidate when working memory capacity exceeded | High | When triggered |
| P4 | `@evidence-based` - Base all investment decisions on rigorous analysis and empirical evidence | Medium | When obsolete |

## 🎯 Investment Management Cognitive Architecture Coordination

### Investment Management Procedural Memory Activation (Context-Dependent):
