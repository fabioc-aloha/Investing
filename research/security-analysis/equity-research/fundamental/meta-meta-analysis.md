## Company Background and Context

### Business Overview
Meta Platforms Inc. operates social media platforms and develops virtual and augmented reality technologies globally. Founded as Facebook in 2004, the company has evolved from a college social network into the world's largest social media ecosystem, reaching 3.88 billion monthly active users across its family of applications including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.

The company's business model centers on advertising revenue generated through sophisticated AI-powered targeting and content recommendation systems. Meta's strategic transformation under CEO Mark Zuckerberg focuses on building the "metaverse" through virtual and augmented reality technologies while maintaining leadership in social media and digital advertising.

### Product Portfolio Analysis
**Family of Apps (97% of revenue)**: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger platforms monetized primarily through advertising. This segment benefits from network effects, data advantages, and global reach providing stable revenue base and cash flow generation.

**Reality Labs (3% of revenue)**: Quest VR headsets, Horizon virtual worlds, AR/VR software development, and metaverse infrastructure. While currently loss-making, this segment represents the company's bet on next-generation computing platforms and social interaction.

The company's AI capabilities span content recommendation, advertising optimization, content moderation, and emerging metaverse applications, creating competitive advantages across all business segments.
