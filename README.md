## �🏗️ Cognitive Architecture Overview

This environment implements a three-layer cognitive memory system:

### 1. **Declarative Memory** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- Global investment management knowledge coordination
- Working memory rules with fiduciary duty prioritization
- Auto-consolidation triggers for cognitive load management

### 2. **Procedural Memory** (`.github/instructions/`)
- Domain-specific instruction files that activate based on file patterns
- 18 specialized instruction modules covering all aspects of investment management
- Context-dependent activation for optimal cognitive efficiency

### 3. **Episodic Memory** (`.github/prompts/`)
