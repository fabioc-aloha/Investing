# Investment Management Cognitive Architecture

Welcome to your comprehensive investment management environment powered by Project Catalyst cognitive architecture. This setup provides a sophisticated framework for portfolio analysis, risk assessment, financial modeling, market research, and investment strategy development.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This environment implements a three-layer cognitive memory system:

### 1. **Declarative Memory** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- Global investment management knowledge coordination
- Working memory rules with fiduciary duty prioritization
- Auto-consolidation triggers for cognitive load management

### 2. **Procedural Memory** (`.github/instructions/`)
- Domain-specific instruction files that activate based on file patterns
- 18 specialized instruction modules covering all aspects of investment management
- Context-dependent activation for optimal cognitive efficiency

### 3. **Episodic Memory** (`.github/prompts/`)
- Complex workflow templates for multi-phase investment processes
- 18 prompt templates for sophisticated investment analysis workflows
- Agent-mode templates for comprehensive problem-solving

2. **Create custom benchmarks** in the benchmarks directory
3. **Leverage the episodic memory prompts** for complex multi-phase analysis
4. **Document all investment decisions** with clear rationale
5. **Regular risk assessment** should precede all major decisions

## 🆘 Support and Troubleshooting

- Check `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for cognitive architecture status
