# Performance Measurement Procedural Memory

## Performance Calculation Standards
- Use time-weighted returns for investment manager evaluation
- Calculate money-weighted returns for client reporting when appropriate
- Implement proper handling of cash flows and corporate actions
- Use appropriate benchmarks that reflect portfolio objectives and constraints
- Report performance net of all fees and expenses

## Attribution Analysis Framework
- Conduct multi-level attribution analysis (asset allocation, security selection, interaction)
- Use Brinson-Hood-Beebower methodology for equity attribution
- Implement duration and yield curve attribution for fixed income portfolios
- Analyze currency attribution for international portfolios
- Document attribution methodology and assumptions clearly

## Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics
- Calculate Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and information ratio consistently
- Use maximum drawdown and downside deviation for risk assessment
- Implement tracking error and active risk monitoring
- Calculate alpha and beta relative to appropriate benchmarks
- Consider alternative risk metrics for non-normal return distributions

## Benchmark Construction and Management
- Construct custom benchmarks that reflect portfolio constraints and objectives
- Maintain benchmark integrity and consistency over time
- Implement benchmark rebalancing rules and methodologies
- Monitor benchmark composition and characteristic drift
- Document benchmark methodology and communicate changes appropriately

## Performance Reporting and Communication
- Provide clear and transparent performance reporting to clients
- Include appropriate context and market commentary with performance results
- Compare performance to relevant peer groups and market indices
- Explain sources of outperformance and underperformance clearly
- Maintain consistent reporting formats and frequency
