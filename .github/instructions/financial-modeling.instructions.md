# Financial Modeling Procedural Memory

## Model Development Standards
- Use clear and logical model structure with appropriate documentation
- Implement robust assumptions and sensitivity analysis
- Validate model inputs and outputs with independent data sources
- Use appropriate statistical methods and avoid overfitting
- Document model limitations and appropriate use cases

## Valuation Methodology
- Use multiple valuation approaches including DCF, relative valuation, and asset-based methods
- Apply appropriate discount rates based on risk and cost of capital
- Consider multiple scenarios in valuation analysis
- Use comparable company analysis and precedent transactions appropriately
- Validate valuation results with market prices and other benchmarks

## Backtesting and Model Validation
- Conduct comprehensive backtesting using out-of-sample data
- Test model performance across different market environments
- Analyze model stability and parameter sensitivity
- Document model performance statistics and limitations
- Implement ongoing model monitoring and validation procedures

## Quantitative Factor Models
- Use academically validated factors with strong theoretical foundations
- Test factor stability and predictive power over time
- Consider factor interactions and non-linear relationships
- Implement appropriate factor timing and combination strategies
- Monitor factor performance and adjust models as needed

## Monte Carlo Simulation and Scenario Modeling
- Use appropriate probability distributions and parameter estimates
- Validate simulation results with analytical solutions where possible
- Consider correlation structures and tail dependencies in simulation
- Implement variance reduction techniques for improved efficiency
- Document simulation assumptions and interpret results appropriately
