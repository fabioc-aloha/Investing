# Security Analysis Procedural Memory

## Document Presentation Standards

### Company Logo Integration (Required for All Equity Analysis)
- **Centered Header Layout**: Center both the document title and logo for professional alignment
- **Single Logo Placement**: Include company logo ONLY at the top of the document header, below the centered title
- **No Duplicate Logos**: Do not repeat the logo in separate "Company Logo" sections within the document body
- **High-Resolution Source**: Always fetch logos in maximum available resolution for crisp display
- **HTML Format Requirements**: Use HTML for both title and logo to ensure proper centering
  ```html
  <div align="center">
  <h1>Company Name (TICKER) - Investment Research</h1>
  <img src="logo_url" alt="Company Name Logo" width="200" height="auto" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto;"/>
  </div>
  ```
- **Size Standards**: 
  - **Source Resolution**: Fetch highest resolution available from logo provider
  - **Display Width**: Scale down to 200px for optimal document readability
  - **Height**: Auto-scale to maintain aspect ratio and prevent distortion
  - **Alignment**: Center-aligned title and logo for professional presentation
  - **CSS Control**: Use inline styles for precise size control regardless of source resolution
- **Source Standards**: Use Finnhub API for reliable, high-resolution company logos:
  - Primary Source: `https://finnhub.io/api/logo?symbol=TICKER` (fetches highest available resolution)
  - Quality: High-resolution PNG/SVG format optimized for financial documents
  - Fallback: Company's official website investor relations page
  - Alternative: SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) with embedded logos
- **Resolution Priority**: Always prioritize image quality over file size for professional presentation
- **Consistency**: Maintain logo aspect ratio and professional appearance across all analyses
- **Legal Compliance**: Logo usage under fair use for financial analysis purposes
- **Professional Presentation**: Logo should enhance document credibility and visual appeal without dominating content

#### Altman Z-Score Financial Distress Analysis
**Mandatory Component for All Equity Analysis - Model Selection Based on Company Characteristics**

##### Model Selection Criteria (Critical - Must Determine First)
- **Original Z-Score (1968)**: Public manufacturing companies, assets >$1M
- **Z'-Score (Private Companies)**: Private manufacturing companies
- **Z"-Score (Non-Manufacturing)**: Public service/non-manufacturing companies
- **Emerging Markets Z-Score**: Companies in developing economies
- **Industry Considerations**: Financial companies NOT recommended (use alternative models)

##### Original Z-Score Model (Public Manufacturing Companies)
**Formula**: Z = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E
- **A** = Working Capital / Total Assets
- **B** = Retained Earnings / Total Assets  
- **C** = EBIT / Total Assets
- **D** = Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities
- **E** = Sales / Total Assets
**Interpretation Zones**:
- Z > 2.99: Safe zone (low bankruptcy risk)
- 1.8 < Z < 2.99: Gray zone (moderate risk) 
- Z < 1.8: Distress zone (high bankruptcy risk)

##### Z'-Score Model (Private Companies)
**Formula**: Z' = 0.717A + 0.847B + 3.107C + 0.420D + 0.998E
- **A** = Working Capital / Total Assets
- **B** = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- **C** = EBIT / Total Assets
- **D** = Book Value of Equity / Total Liabilities (Note: Book value, not market value)
- **E** = Sales / Total Assets
**Interpretation Zones**:
- Z' > 2.9: Safe zone
- 1.23 < Z' < 2.9: Gray zone
- Z' < 1.23: Distress zone

##### Z"-Score Model (Non-Manufacturing/Service Companies)
**Formula**: Z" = 6.56X1 + 3.26X2 + 6.72X3 + 1.05X4
- **X1** = Working Capital / Total Assets
- **X2** = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- **X3** = EBIT / Total Assets
- **X4** = Book Value of Equity / Total Liabilities
**Interpretation Zones**:
- Z" > 2.6: Safe zone
- 1.1 < Z" < 2.6: Gray zone
- Z" < 1.1: Distress zone

##### Emerging Markets Z-Score Model
**Formula**: Z-EM = 3.25 + 6.56X1 + 3.26X2 + 6.72X3 + 1.05X4
- **X1** = Working Capital / Total Assets
- **X2** = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- **X3** = EBIT / Total Assets
- **X4** = Book Value of Equity / Total Liabilities
**Interpretation Zones**: Same as Z"-Score model

##### Implementation Requirements
- **Model Justification**: Document why specific Z-Score model was selected based on company characteristics
- **Data Sources**: Specify exact financial statement dates and sources for all components
- **Alternative Models**: For financial companies, use Ohlson O-Score, Beneish M-Score, or industry-specific models
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test impact of key assumption changes on Z-Score results
- **Trend Analysis**: Calculate Z-Score for 3-5 year historical period to assess trajectory
- **Peer Comparison**: Compare Z-Score to industry benchmarks and direct competitors
- **Balance Sheet Assumptions**: Document all assumptions used for missing data with clear rationale
- **Risk Integration**: Integrate Z-Score results into overall investment recommendation and risk rating

##### Special Considerations
- **Industry Limitations**: Z-Score less reliable for utilities, REITs, and capital-intensive industries
- **Economic Cycles**: Z-Score accuracy varies across business cycles and economic conditions
- **Company Life Stage**: Model effectiveness differs for mature vs. growth-stage companies
- **Recent Updates**: As of 2019, Professor Altman noted Z-Score closer to 0 (not 1.8) indicates heightened distress risk
- **Complementary Analysis**: Always use Z-Score alongside other financial distress models for comprehensive assessment

#### Piotroski F-Score Analysis
**Mandatory Component for All Equity Analysis - Fundamental Quality Assessment**

The Piotroski F-Score complements the Altman Z-Score by evaluating fundamental business quality and financial strength through 9 binary criteria. Developed by Joseph Piotroski (2000), this score identifies financially strong companies with improving fundamentals.

**Important Note**: Unlike Altman Z-Score, the Piotroski F-Score uses a **single standardized formula** across all company types (public/private, manufacturing/service, developed/emerging markets). However, **interpretation benchmarks** vary by industry.

##### Piotroski F-Score Components (9 Criteria - 1 point each)

**Profitability Signals (4 criteria)**:
1. **Positive Net Income**: 1 point if current year net income > 0
2. **Positive Operating Cash Flow**: 1 point if current year operating cash flow > 0
3. **Increasing ROA**: 1 point if current year ROA > prior year ROA
4. **Quality Earnings**: 1 point if operating cash flow > net income (earnings quality)

**Leverage, Liquidity & Source of Funds (3 criteria)**:
5. **Decreasing Leverage**: 1 point if current year debt/assets < prior year debt/assets
6. **Increasing Liquidity**: 1 point if current year current ratio > prior year current ratio
7. **No Share Dilution**: 1 point if shares outstanding current year â‰¤ prior year

**Operating Efficiency (2 criteria)**:
8. **Increasing Gross Margin**: 1 point if current year gross margin > prior year gross margin
9. **Increasing Asset Turnover**: 1 point if current year asset turnover > prior year asset turnover

##### F-Score Calculation and Interpretation
**Total Score Range**: 0-9 points
**General Interpretation**:
- **F-Score 8-9**: Excellent fundamental quality (strong buy candidates)
- **F-Score 6-7**: Good fundamental quality (moderate buy candidates)
- **F-Score 4-5**: Average fundamental quality (hold/neutral)
- **F-Score 2-3**: Weak fundamental quality (caution/avoid)
- **F-Score 0-1**: Poor fundamental quality (strong avoid/short candidates)

##### Industry-Specific Benchmark Considerations
**Manufacturing Companies**: Typically score higher on efficiency metrics (asset turnover, margins)
**Service Companies**: May show different patterns in asset turnover due to lower asset intensity
**Financial Companies**: Limited applicability due to unique business model and regulatory requirements
**Technology Companies**: Growth-stage companies may score lower on profitability metrics initially
**Utilities/REITs**: Asset turnover expectations should be adjusted for industry characteristics

##### Implementation Requirements
- **Universal Formula**: Use same 9-criteria calculation regardless of company characteristics
- **Two-Year Comparison**: Requires current year and prior year financial data
- **Data Sources**: Use audited financial statements (10-K) for accuracy
- **Calculation Transparency**: Document each of the 9 criteria with specific values
- **Trend Analysis**: Calculate F-Score for 3-5 year period to assess trajectory
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Compare F-Score to industry peers for context
- **Share Count Adjustments**: Account for stock splits and spinoffs in dilution analysis

##### Integration with Z-Score Analysis
**Combined Scoring Matrix**:
- **High Z-Score (>2.99) + High F-Score (8-9)**: Optimal investment candidates
- **High Z-Score (>2.99) + Low F-Score (0-3)**: Financial stability but weak fundamentals
- **Low Z-Score (<1.8) + High F-Score (8-9)**: Turnaround candidates with strong fundamentals
- **Low Z-Score (<1.8) + Low F-Score (0-3)**: High-risk investments to avoid

##### Special Considerations
- **Universal Application**: Same formula works across all company types (key difference from Z-Score)
- **Growth vs. Value**: F-Score particularly effective for value investing strategies
- **Industry Context**: Interpret scores relative to industry averages rather than absolute thresholds
- **Economic Cycles**: F-Score effectiveness may vary across different market conditions
- **Company Life Stage**: More relevant for mature companies with established operations
- **Cyclical Limitations**: Year-over-year comparisons may be misleading during economic cycles

**Risk Assessment Integration**: Use both Z-Score (financial distress) and F-Score (fundamental quality) to create comprehensive financial health assessment supporting investment recommendations.
