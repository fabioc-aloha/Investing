# Portfolio Analysis Procedural Memory

## Portfolio Construction Principles
- Begin with clear investment objectives and constraints
- Use strategic asset allocation as the foundation for portfolio construction
- Implement appropriate diversification across asset classes, geographies, and sectors
- Consider liquidity needs and time horizon in asset selection
- Balance risk and return expectations with client goals and constraints

## Asset Allocation Framework
- Develop strategic asset allocation based on long-term capital market assumptions
- Implement tactical asset allocation adjustments based on market conditions
- Use mean reversion and momentum signals appropriately in allocation decisions
- Consider alternative investments for enhanced diversification
- Rebalance portfolios systematically to maintain target allocations

## Security Selection Process
- Use fundamental analysis as the primary basis for security selection
- Supplement fundamental analysis with quantitative and technical factors
- Consider valuation, quality, and momentum factors in security selection
- Implement appropriate screening processes for ESG and other criteria
- Monitor security-level risk and concentration continuously

## Portfolio Optimization Techniques
- Use mean-variance optimization with appropriate constraints and adjustments
- Consider Black-Litterman and other advanced optimization techniques
- Implement risk budgeting and risk parity approaches where appropriate
- Account for transaction costs and tax implications in optimization
- Validate optimization results with scenario analysis and stress testing

## Performance Attribution and Analysis
- Conduct detailed attribution analysis at multiple levels (asset allocation, security selection)
- Analyze performance relative to benchmarks and peer groups
- Identify sources of alpha and areas for improvement
- Monitor tracking error and information ratio continuously
- Document lessons learned and incorporate into future portfolio construction
