# Asset Allocation Procedural Memory

## Strategic Asset Allocation Framework
- Develop long-term capital market assumptions based on fundamental analysis
- Use mean-variance optimization with appropriate constraints and risk budgets
- Consider liability-driven investment principles for institutional portfolios
- Implement multi-period optimization for long-term investment horizons
- Account for human capital and other non-financial assets in allocation decisions

## Tactical Asset Allocation Process
- Monitor market valuations and economic indicators for tactical opportunities
- Use systematic signals including momentum, valuation, and sentiment indicators
- Implement tactical ranges around strategic allocations with defined limits
- Consider market cycle timing and mean reversion patterns
- Document tactical allocation decisions with clear rationale and time horizons

## Alternative Asset Integration
- Evaluate alternative investments for diversification and return enhancement
- Consider illiquidity premiums and lock-up periods in allocation decisions
- Assess correlation benefits and tail risk characteristics of alternatives
- Implement appropriate due diligence processes for alternative managers
- Monitor alternative allocations for concentration and operational risks

## Dynamic Allocation Strategies
- Implement risk parity and volatility targeting approaches where appropriate
- Use systematic rebalancing rules based on drift tolerances and time schedules
- Consider transaction costs and tax implications in rebalancing decisions
- Monitor allocation performance and attribution on ongoing basis
- Adjust allocation framework based on changing market conditions and objectives

## Multi-Asset Risk Management
- Implement comprehensive risk budgeting across asset classes
- Monitor factor exposures and unintended risk concentrations
- Use stress testing and scenario analysis for allocation robustness
- Consider currency hedging strategies for international allocations
- Maintain appropriate liquidity buffers for portfolio operations
