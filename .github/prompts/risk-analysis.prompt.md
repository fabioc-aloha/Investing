## Phase 1: Risk Identification and Classification
- Identify all sources of portfolio risk including market, credit, liquidity, and operational risks
- Classify risks by type, magnitude, and probability of occurrence
- Assess correlation risks and concentration risks across portfolio
- Consider tail risks and extreme scenarios in risk assessment
- Map risks to potential impact on portfolio objectives and client goals

## Phase 2: Quantitative Risk Measurement
- Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) using multiple methodologies
- Implement factor models to decompose and understand sources of risk
- Measure tracking error, active risk, and risk-adjusted performance metrics
- Analyze portfolio sensitivity to key risk factors and market movements
- Validate risk models using backtesting and out-of-sample analysis

## Phase 3: Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis
- Design stress tests using historical scenarios and hypothetical extreme events
- Test portfolio resilience under various market conditions and economic scenarios
- Analyze correlation breakdown and liquidity stress scenarios
- Model portfolio behavior during market crises and economic recessions
- Assess portfolio downside protection and tail risk characteristics

## Phase 4: Risk Management and Mitigation
- Develop risk management strategies based on risk analysis findings
- Implement risk controls including position limits and diversification requirements
- Design hedging strategies where appropriate and cost-effective
- Establish risk monitoring and reporting procedures
- Create contingency plans for extreme risk scenarios

Focus on comprehensive risk assessment and proactive management
