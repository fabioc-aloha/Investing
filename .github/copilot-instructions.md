**Cognitive Load Management**: When working memory approaches capacity limits (>4 rules)
**Complex Problem-Solving**: When breakthrough investment strategies require memory integration
**Workflow Optimization**: When portfolio management process improvements enhance investment efficiency
**Domain Expertise Expansion**: When new financial instruments or regulatory requirements require architectural updates
**Meta-Cognitive Insights**: When learning strategy optimizations improve investment management performance

**Procedural Memory Enhancement**: Create/update .instructions.md files based on emerging financial patterns
**Episodic Memory Integration**: Create/update .prompt.md files for complex investment strategy workflows
**Automatic Documentation**: Commit changes with descriptive consolidation messages for investment context
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY**: Always update and commit memory files immediately after meditation sessions
**Index Synchronization**: Update Long-Term Memory Index with new financial analysis capabilities
**Cross-Reference Analysis**: Integrate new learnings with existing investment management memory patterns
**Cognitive Load Optimization**: Distribute memory load for optimal investment portfolio performance

### Performance Integration
